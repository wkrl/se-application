/**
 * Modularizing systems into components and parts requires interfaces to be
 * defined between components and their internal and external parts.
 * 
 * Public interface ComponentIntf defines a number of interfaces for components:
 *  - LogicIntf, ViewIntf, RepositoryIntf
 * 
 * All interfaces are top-level interfaces that will be sub-typed by specific
 * component classes (refer to components such as Calculator with specific interfaces:
 * \\
 *  - Calculator.ViewIntf extends ComponentIntf.ViewIntf { ... } and
 *  - Calculator.LogicIntf extends ComponentIntf.LogicIntf { ... }.
 * 
 * as examples.
